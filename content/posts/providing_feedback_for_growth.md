In our company (as in almost any other), we have a performance review process, and part of that process is peer feedback. Recently, I had a couple of discussions about what makes good, constructive feedback and realized that, for some engineers, the most challenging part is identifying areas for improvement. 

For them, it feels like you have to point out mistakes a person made — and if there were no obvious mistakes, then there's nothing to say in that section.

I used to have a similar problem, so I’ve decided to share my current approach.

Now, I’m not looking for mistakes to highlight (though if there were mistakes, it's always good to suggest how to avoid them). Instead, I focus on **areas that weren’t demonstrated** by the person I’m giving feedback about.

The fact that someone hasn't demonstrated a particular skill doesn’t mean they’re not competent. They may very well have the skill but simply haven’t had an opportunity to show it. For example, they might be a fantastic organizer but have only worked on solo projects or under someone else's direction so far.

This shift in mindset has really simplified things for me — I no longer feel guilty about “cherry-picking” minor issues. I think instead about what **signals I might be missing** from the person. What could they do to better show that they have the skills we value or expect?

This approach also makes it easier to write feedback for brilliant, smart people you enjoy working with. You're not blaming them for anything; you're suggesting what else they could **showcase** to support your belief that they're great.

I hope this approach to giving feedback helps others the way it’s helped me.
