Our app is currently migrating to a new dependency injection (DI) framework. One of the standout features of this new framework is **method injection** — a powerful tool that gives developers more flexibility than traditional constructor injection.

But as the saying goes: **"With great power comes great responsibility."** 😉

In this post, I want to share a few challenges we've run into with method injection. This isn’t an exhaustive list, and the items are in no particular order — but they’ve all been painful in one way or another.

## 1. Method Injection Makes Dependencies Harder to Track

With **constructor injection**, all of a class's dependencies are declared up front, in the constructor. This makes it easy to understand what a class needs in order to function. You can glance at the constructor and immediately know its required services.

With **method injection**, that clarity disappears. Dependencies are scattered across different methods. Unless you're using a powerful tool to introspect and analyze class dependencies, you might struggle to figure out what a class actually needs.

This fragmentation adds cognitive overhead and increases the chances of accidentally missing or duplicating dependencies.

## 2. Method Injection Breaks Assumptions About Static Methods

Traditionally, static methods are viewed as **pure functions** — they depend only on their input parameters and have no external dependencies.

But method injection changes that paradigm.

When a static method receives injected dependencies, it now implicitly relies on context outside its parameters. This undermines one of the key benefits of static methods: **predictability**. It also blurs the line between functional and stateful behavior, which can make code harder to reason about and maintain.

## 3. Testing Becomes Harder (and More Fragile)

One of the major benefits of constructor injection is that it **forces** you to provide all dependencies when creating an object. This makes unit testing more reliable — you can't forget a dependency because the object won't compile or run without it.

With method injection, it's possible to instantiate objects without providing any dependencies at all. This can lead to:

- **Silent failures** in tests when methods aren't called during setup.
- **Unexpected behavior** when missing dependencies aren't noticed until runtime.
- **Harder-to-debug issues** when mocks aren't properly configured — especially if the original author skipped them and the tests “just happened to work.”

If you introduce **static method injection** into the mix, things get even worse. You’ve now got a highly dynamic system where your test setup might not reflect the actual production behavior — and small changes to the code can break a test suite in surprising ways.

## 4. The Slippery Slope: Testing Fatigue

All of these challenges add up. As tests become more brittle and harder to debug, teams may begin to feel like:

> "Tests are slowing us down."

This is a dangerous mindset. If developers start seeing tests as a burden rather than a safety net, they may stop writing them altogether — or worse, ignore failing ones.

In many ways, **method injection increases the attack surface of your code**, especially in a large, fast-moving codebase. Without strict discipline and robust tooling, it can introduce more chaos than clarity.

## Conclusion

Method injection is a powerful feature. Used carefully, it can enable new patterns and improve flexibility. But if you're considering using it heavily (or allowing it in static methods), be aware of the hidden costs:

- Loss of visibility into class dependencies
- Fragile assumptions about static behavior
- Increased complexity in testing
- Risk of test suite rot and developer frustration

If you're migrating to a new DI framework that supports method injection, proceed with caution — and be sure to set clear guidelines for your team. Flexibility is great, but structure is what keeps us sane.
