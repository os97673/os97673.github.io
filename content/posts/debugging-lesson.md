TLDR: When deep debugging fails, a second set of eyes (and reading the error) can save the day.

Recently, a colleague of mine was digging into a tricky issue in one of our systems. We were consistently failing to restore certain files, and he set out to find the root cause. His approach was thorough and data-driven: he analyzed how often the problem occurred, added extensive logging, and tried to understand the system’s behavior as if it were a black box.

Despite all the effort, progress was slow. The analysis was solid, but something wasn’t clicking.

Eventually, we sat down together to look at it again. This time, we started by simply reading the actual error message and stepping through the code where the failure was happening. Almost immediately, we noticed something important: the problem wasn’t with the files themselves—it was with how the application was attempting to fetch the decryption key from the server. Without that key, the restoration was doomed to fail. The core issue was in the logic responsible for pre-fetching keys, not the data.

I was able to help because I wasn’t too invested in the initial investigation. Coming in with a fresh perspective allowed me to see the problem from another angle. It’s a powerful reminder: sometimes, the simplest path—reading the error message, checking the surrounding code—is the most effective. And it’s easy to miss when you're deep in the weeds.

I’ve definitely been on the other side of this before. When you're too close to a problem, it’s surprisingly hard to take a step back and see it clearly. This experience reinforced the value of peer collaboration and occasionally hitting reset to look at a problem anew.
